## Hey, I'm Ayush! ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior majoring in Computer Engineering at UMass Amherst, passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. With hands-on experience in Python, C, SQL, R, MATLAB, and Java, I am especially interested in data science and machine learning applications in finance and other sectors. I am actively expanding my knowledge in cloud computing technologies, including AWS and Microsoft Azure.

Outside of academics, I am a member of my universityâ€™s humanoid robotics team. I also enjoy staying active by going to the gym and playing basketball with friends.
